# Autonomous Vehicle Project â€“ Real-Time Control & Line Following

## Overview
This project (Sessions Iâ€“IV of the Applied Electrical & Electronic Engineering construction labs) involved designing and building a four-wheel autonomous robotic vehicle with **Arduino-based control, HMI (Humanâ€“Machine Interface), real-time motion sensing, wireless communication, and multi-sensor line following**.  

The work spanned from basic motor drivers to advanced PID control with optical sensors, integrating both **hardware circuit design** and **firmware development**.

  - Implemented H-bridge motor driver for bidirectional control.  
  - Designed real-time system operation (RT sinewave generator).  
  - Built HMI with LCD, encoder, buzzer, and buttons for vehicle status monitoring.  
  - Established serial communication between dual Arduino microcontrollers.  

- **Session 3â€“4:**  
  - Integrated **MPU-6050 accelerometer & gyroscope** for motion sensing.  
  - Developed **wireless communication** using nRF24L01 (RF) and HC-06 (Bluetooth), enabling remote control via joystick or smartphone.  
  - Constructed a **logic gate interface board** with 74-series ICs.  
  - Implemented **line following** using TCRT5000 optical sensors (Bang-bang control).  
  - Advanced to **PID-controlled line following** with SF-8CHIDTS 8-channel module, achieving smooth trajectory tracking.  
  - Designed HMI for **real-time PID parameter tuning** and LCD status display.
